# Wheel Of Fortune 

## Project Description

This project was an opportunity to explore the use of ES6 classes and object oritented program. As Turing students, previous projects allowed for some exposure to this type of organization, but this was the first chance we had to create a game solely based on this code structure. Another large portion of this project was to implement a testing suite for not only the class interactions, but also any updates made on the DOM.

## Setup

### Next Steps:
- After Solve Puzzel, iterate through the game's wheels and puzzles for subsequent rounds. This will be set up dynamically by matching the round number to the indices of the wheels and puzzles. After each round, the winner's score will be added to his/her total score, and all players' round scores will be reset to zero.
- After completing 4 rounds, the player with the highest total score will be declared the winner will play in a bonus round. If the bonus puzzel is answered correctly their screen will be showed with animations of glory. 

### Tested With:
